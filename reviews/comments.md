Reviewer A:

The manuscript presents a grand tour approach to non-linear dimenionality reduction in clustering tasks. It adds a relevant innovation to the scientiifc literature and isc highly relevant for the JDSSV audience. While the manuscript is well written, there are a few points in which I believe further clarification and focus will improve the readability of th epaper and the reception of its content.Please see attached file for specifics.

Unfortunately, I was not able to run the provided code. My guess is that there is some incompatibility with the newest R-version 4-0-3. Please check!

Reviewer B:

This is a well-written paper on a nice idea backed up with some impressive programming.

The use of a tour to clarify the output of NLDR such as t-SNE seems like a valuable one.  I do feel like maybe it would be worthwhile to expand on some of the case studies to demonstrate the best use of liminal.

For example, the various clusters came pre-colored.  I would like to see a little more about how the analyst would identify these clusters, especially in a case such as your tree example where it doesn't appear that you would have the coloring/clustering you have without a priori knowledge of the different branches.  Is it possible to create that clustering starting from the tour or the embedding?

Would it be worthwhile to link a pairwise scatterplot matrix for all or a subset of the original variables or components so as to be able to relate clusters and other features via brushing back to those variables for interpretation?  I guess the biplot in Figure 7 may be intended to show something similar?  Is it possible to expand and clarify your results from this figure a bit for those of us who are not genomics specialists?
