00:01.000 --> 00:05.000
Example high-dimensional tree shaped data in one hundred dimensions. 

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
The true data lies on a 2 dimensional tree consisting of ten branches, where the blue group is the backbone.

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
The t-SNE view has broken up the topology of the data. If we click on the legend, the blue points are highlighted.

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
We see that t-SNE has split the backbone of the tree into three groups, while those points are preserved in high dimensional space.
