00:01.000 --> 00:05.000
Here we have modified the default t-SNE parameters to better preserve global structure. 


00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
The t-SNE view has split the tree into it's three constituent branches. 

00:11.000 --> 00:20.000
If we brush the tips of two branches on the t-SNE view we can see how far apart they are in high dimensional space.

00:21.000 --> 00:30.000
The tips of the yellow and brown branches (which appear to be close to each other
on the t-SNE view) are distored in the t-SNE view. 

00:31.000 --> 00:38.000
This is apparent by viewing the tour animation, the two branches are really quite far apart.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
So there's still a bit of work to do to fix up the t-SNE view.
