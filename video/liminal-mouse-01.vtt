00:01.000 --> 00:05.000
This is the liminal interface applied to single cell RNA-seq data. 

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
Here we are interested in learning cell types and their relations by first clustering the gene expression counts. 

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
On the left hand side we have an embedding of this data using t-SNE. On the right a grand tour.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
We learn that the embedding has mostly captured the clusters relative location to each other to their location. 

00:25.000 --> 00:32.000
With a notable exception of points in cluster 3 and 10 as shown with linked brushing, we can see that the edges of these clusters are far apart.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
t-SNE mitigates the crowding problem that is an issue for tour. 

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
Points in clusters 2, 4, 6, and 11 are clumped together in tour view, but are blown up in the embedding view.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
Brushing on the tour view, reveals points in cluster 9 that are diffuse in the embedding 
view.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
Points in cluster 9 are relatively far away and spread apart from other 
clusters in the tour view

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
But has points placed in cluster 3 and 9 in the embedding.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
Letting the tour animation play out, we see the structure of the data appear.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
The cells form a tetrahedron, with points lying along the surface and the vertices.
