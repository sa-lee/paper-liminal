00:01.000 --> 00:03.000
This dataset has two Gaussian clusters with equal covariance embedded in 10 dimensions. 

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
And a third cluster with hierarchical structure. 
This cluster itself has two 3 dimensional clusters embedded in 10 dimensions.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
The second cluster is subdivided into three smaller clusters, that are each equidistant from each other and have the same covariance structure

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
Brushing on the t-SNE view shows that, we see that the relative distance between clusters is exaggerated.

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
In the tour view the blue clusters are closer together, while t-SNE has pushed them apart.


00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
As we zoom in and perform more brushing the extent of the distortion in the t-SNE embedding becomes more apparent.
