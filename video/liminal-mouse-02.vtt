00:01.000 --> 00:05.000
This is the liminal interface applied to looking at marker genes in single cell RNA-seq data. 

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
We select the top 10 marker genes that are upregulated in cluster 2. 

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
The basis generation (shown as the biplot on the left view) reflects the relative weighting of each gene.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
The tour becomes an alternative to a standard heatmap view for assessing shared markers.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000 
After zooming, we can see a trajectory forming along the clusters.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
Using linked highlighting we can view clusters individually or together to see if these markers separate them.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
The expression of the marker genes, appear to separate clusters 2, 4, 6, and 11.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
This indicates that these genes are expressed in all four clusters.
